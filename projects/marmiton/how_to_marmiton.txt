instructions on how to test the script marmiton.sh

- open your terminal

- go to the project repository (marmiton)

- type in chmod +x marmiton.sh to make the script executable

- type in ./marmiton.sh to launch it
--> You'll see this error : rm: impossible de supprimer «/tmp/raw»: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type
This is normal because you don't have (yet) this temp file. It'll be used to store the retreived html content. 

- Once it's launch, it will ask you 2 questions : 

	- first the recipe you're looking for, such as the word 'baguette'
--> If the recipe researched doesn't correspond to any result, the script stops and you'll have to restart it using ./marmiton.sh to further continue.

	- second how you want to sort the results by (title, votes, type, preparation time, cooking time or the number for which the recipe is done) : you'll have to enter the number corresponding to your choice, from 1 to 6.  
--> You can try to type in letters, complete words or numbers which don't correspond, it won't work and the script will ask you to try again. 

- Depending on your choices, you'll have a different set of results. For example : the first six pages corresponding to baguette sorted by the number of votes. 
--> The script will stop at this point. You can launch it again with ./marmiton.sh
